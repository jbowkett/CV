### Summary
I am a proven fast learner, looking to build on over 12 years experience using 
Java in various enterprise environments.  My most recent experience has been as
the lead developer for a highly agile TDD/BDD Ruby team. I am looking to make a 
return to working with large datasets (both relational and non-relational) 
and continuing to use TDD/BDD techniques to apply the principles of SOLID 
design to produce clean code regardless of the language.

I am an Associate at the Graduate Developer Community, and I enjoy attending 
both GDC and LJC events and conferences.
